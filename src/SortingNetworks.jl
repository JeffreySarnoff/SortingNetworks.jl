"""
    Sorting networks for 1,2,..16 and 17,18..25 values are given.  
    These sorting networks should minimize conditional swaps.  
    The first sixteen are known to minimize conditional swaps.  
    
    Functions are a sequence of internally parallelizable blocks.
    Functions are written using empty lines as block delmiters.
